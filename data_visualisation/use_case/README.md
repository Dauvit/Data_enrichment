# Use case #

[Task group 1](http://wiki.pro-ibiosphere.eu/wiki/Task_Groups#Task_Group_1:_Data_Visualization) is working on data visualisation to meet Jeremyâ€™s use case. His vision is set out in  `useCase.txt`, which guides you to the other files with sample data and outputs. Our task is to write the code that will automate that process.
