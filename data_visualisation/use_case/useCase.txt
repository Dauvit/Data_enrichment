Hello all,
Here is a proposal for the hackathon that should be pretty close to the core of pro-iBiosphere. 
The idea is simply to extract structured data from treatments in a simple spreadsheet-friendly 
format for the purposes of quality control and visualization. I have made a list of the desired 
fields (fields tab in markupDataExtractionFields.xls) and attached several documents that have 
been marked up using GoldenGATE. I've organized the fields into two tables, one for authors 
and institutions, and the other for data (there can be many authors/institutions per publication). 
The tabs exampleDataTable and exampleAuthorTable are populated with a small amount real 
data for illustration of the desired output. 
With data structured in this way, several forms of visualization/dashboarding are possible. Some 
mocked up examples are given in the attached ppt. The first step in this process would be to 
produce a series of charts, maps and lists that at a glance deliver a wealth of information about 
the data that underlies any individual treatment. These would include data on proportions of male 
and female specimens, the proportion of specimens that come from major collections institutions, 
a list of countries, and a map of georeferenced data points. Visualizations based on sets of 
treatments could follow proportions of specimens from major institutions as published in a 
taxonomic journal over time, or follow the activity of a particular collector over space and time. 
Ultimately, the goal is a kind of reverse Biodiversity Data Journal - resurrect the primary data 
from legacy literature for aggregation and reanalysis. 
Kind regards,
Jeremy
